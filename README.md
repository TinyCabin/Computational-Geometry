# Computational-Geometry

This project contains several implementations of common **computational geometry** algorithms and techniques, focusing on geometric structures, mesh creation, point location, and various geometric computations. The goal is to provide efficient solutions to geometric problems that arise in computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), and robotics.

## ðŸ”§ Features

This project includes implementations of the following computational geometry techniques:

### ðŸ§© Mesh Creation
This section contains code for generating and working with geometric meshes. Mesh generation is crucial for simulations, finite element analysis, and computer graphics. It involves constructing a set of vertices and edges that define the boundaries.

### ðŸŒ³ Range Tree
This folder implements **range trees**, a data structure used for multidimensional range querying. It's useful for problems where you need to query or find points in a multidimensional space that satisfy specific conditions, like finding all points within a rectangular region.

### ðŸ”¶ Shapes, Lines, and Others
This folder contains implementations for basic geometric entities such as **points, lines**, and other shapes like convex hulls. The classes in this section are fundamental for many geometric algorithms.

### ðŸš€ Spaceship
The **Spaceship** simulation demonstrates the movement of a spaceship (modeled as a polygon) under attack by missiles. It incorporates computational geometry algorithms such as convex hulls, point-in-polygon testing, and trajectory simulation. The simulation uses the Jarvis March and Graham Scan algorithms for convex hull computation, and ray-casting for point-in-polygon checks.

### ðŸ”º Triangulation
This folder contains methods for **polygon triangulation**, which is the process of dividing a polygon into triangles. This is an important problem in computational geometry with applications in rendering, physics
